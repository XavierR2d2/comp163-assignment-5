# Why did you choose each loop type for each challenge
#For Challenge one, I chose a while state due to the fact that whatever number was input could be bigger than whatever was set if I used the for statement.

#For Challenge two, I picked a for statement because the inputting of a start and finish of the loop would allow it to have a set amount of loops I could use for the for loop.

# Lastly, for the final challenge, I picked another for loop since we are doing a set amount of multiplication for the table. It was easy to figure out the set amount I needed for both loops.

# How did your Solutions work?
#for the first challenge, I made it so that the user could input their starting number, and based on whatever number it was, it would use the Collatz rule to get it down to 1. Then it would also show the steps it took and how many steps it took to get that input number to 1

#for the second challenge i make it so that the user can enter whatever number they want and depending on that number its going to sub tract one from that inputed number to get the end  of the ranage with the set start being 2 then will see if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder then the inputed number is prime but if it it has a remainder it will say its not prime and say where it was divisible by, then break

#for the last challenge, it'll just print the multiplication table

# Any AI Assistance Used
#Chat GPT was used to help format and find errors in my code, and was a big help in figuring out how I could make the multiplication table
